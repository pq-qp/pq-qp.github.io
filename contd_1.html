    <p>You end up in a cave. There, a miner demanded, "You can return to the surface only if I had found 1000 diamonds!" You ask, "How many diamonds had you found?" "None of your business! Then, a sack of diamonds fell from the ceiling. You count the number of diamonds in the sack: 334. The miner took the sack and counted exactly 1000 diamonds. You subtract 334 from 1000 and you get 666. You burst into tears again and flooded the cave. Then you swam in your own tears back to the surface.
